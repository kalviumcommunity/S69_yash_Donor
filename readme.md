### Project Proposal:Donor Hive

## Project Overview
Donor Hive is a web platform designed to connect blood donors with hospitals, NGOs, and recipients in real-time. The platform provides a transparent, location-based system that enables donors to find urgent requests, schedule donations, and track their impact. Hospitals and NGOs can list blood requirements, manage inventory, and send emergency alerts to potential donors.

## Problem Statement
Lack of Donor Visibility – Hospitals struggle to locate suitable donors during emergencies.


Inefficient Communication – Blood requests are often shared via social media or word-of-mouth, leading to delays.


No Centralized System – Donors find it difficult to discover urgent blood donation opportunities nearby.


Low Donor Retention – Donors lack incentives and visibility into how their donations make a difference.


## Proposed Solution
For Donors:
Search & Filter – Find blood requests based on blood type, location, and urgency.


Appointment Scheduling – Book donation slots at hospitals and NGOs.


Impact Dashboard – Track donation history and receive updates on how donations helped patients.


For Hospitals/NGOs:
Inventory Management – Update blood stock levels in real-time.


Emergency Alerts – Notify compatible donors via SMS/email for urgent cases.


Analytics Dashboard – Monitor donation trends and forecast shortages.


## Key Features
✅ Smart Matching – Alerts for nearby blood requests matching donor blood type. 
✅ Real-Time Tracking – Hospitals update blood stock levels; donors see donation impact.
✅ Emergency Alerts – SMS/email notifications for urgent blood requests.
✅ Donor Rewards – Gamification elements (badges, milestones) to encourage repeat donations.
